# Seat Reservation System

## Project Overview

This project is a simple seat reservation system for a train coach built using React. The system allows users to book up to 7 seats at a time and displays seat availability visually. The application also handles the booking of scattered seats if enough contiguous seats are not available.

## Features

- **Interactive Seat Map**: Visual representation of seats showing booked, available, and user-reserved seats.
- **Booking Logic**: Users can book multiple seats (up to 7) at once, with priority given to contiguous seats in a row. If not enough contiguous seats are available, nearby available seats can be booked.
- **Responsive Design**: The seat map is responsive and works well on various screen sizes.
- **Tooltips**: Hover over seats to see their availability status.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: Styling for layout and visuals.
